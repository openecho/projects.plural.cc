h1. Redmine Youtube Macro Plugin

This is a "Redmine":http://www.redmine.org/ plugin that adds a new macro to embed "YouTube":http://youtube.com videos into wiki pages.

h3. Usage

To embed a video you have to extract the video key from the YouTube URL and provide it as input to the macro. For example the URL,

"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3N1MlvVc4":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3N1MlvVc4

is the YouTube link to Gary Jules version of Mad World. The video key for this URL is *4N3N1MlvVc4*. Use this key in they youtube macro as follows,

*{{youtube(4N3N1MlvVc4)}}*

You can also size the video if you have a specific space to fill using,

*{{youtube(4N3N1MlvVc4,800,600)}}*

The result is a nice YouTube video in your text content.
